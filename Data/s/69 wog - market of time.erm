** Market of Time ERM Script Version 1.3.3 created by Timothy E. Pulver
** This script requires WoG Version 3.56 and ERM Version 2.5 to use. 
** WoGify Name: script09.erm 
** V1.3.3 update by Tobyn "Warfare support"
** V1.3.2 update by Overlord "extended dialogue 3 + single skill check" 
** (changes v1.3.1 - bug found: 27 skill looping correction) 
** Updated: July 18, 2004.
 
** This script sets up all Markets of Time on a map to function as locations 
** where heroes can forget skills they have learned for a cost of 2000 gold. 
** When a hero visits a Market of Time, the player is invited to choose which 
** skill he wants to forget. A hero can forget a maximum of one skill per 
** day and 500 movement points are deducted from the hero's move that turn 
** (it takes awhile to meditate). 
 
** To install this script in a map, simply copy & paste the code into a global 
** (timed) event. Copy the entire code, from ZVSE to the end. Make sure that 
** you disable ALL colours from receiving the event and/or change the event 
** day to something like 500 or later to avoid the ERM script popping up as if 
** it were a regular event message. 
 
** And of course, you'll also need to put one or more Market of Time objects 
** on your map for the heroes to visit. Have fun forgetting! :-) 
 
** Version 1.3 adds compatibility with enhanced skills that have their name 
** shown in yellow text.
